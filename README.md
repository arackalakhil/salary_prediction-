Salary Prediction Project
Overview
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict salaries based on a dataset containing employee information such as age, gender, education level, job title, and years of experience. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (first_prediction_project.ipynb) using Python and common data science libraries.
The notebook includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and visualization of actual vs. predicted salaries. The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates salaries based on the provided features and evaluate its performance.
Dataset
The dataset used is Salary Data.csv, which includes the following columns:

Age: Age of the employee (numeric).
Gender: Gender of the employee (categorical: Male/Female).
Education Level: Education level of the employee (categorical: Bachelor's, Master's, PhD).
Job Title: Job role of the employee (categorical).
Years of Experience: Number of years of professional experience (numeric).
Salary: Annual salary of the employee (numeric, target variable).

Dataset Notes

The dataset contains 375 rows and 6 columns.
There are 2 rows with missing values across all columns, which need to be handled during preprocessing.
The minimum salary ($350) may indicate an outlier or data entry error and should be investigated.

Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Alternatively, use a requirements.txt file with the following content:
pandas==2.2.2
numpy==1.26.4
matplotlib==3.9.2
seaborn==0.13.2
scikit-learn==1.5.1

Install dependencies from requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Setup

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/salary-prediction-project.git
cd salary-prediction-project


Place the Dataset:

Download or obtain the Salary Data.csv file.
Place it in the project directory or update the file path in the notebook (data = pd.read_csv(...)) to point to the correct location.


Set Up the Environment:

Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
Install the required libraries as described above.


Run the Notebook:

Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook


Open first_prediction_project.ipynb in the Jupyter interface and run the cells sequentially.




Usage
The notebook is structured as follows:

Data Loading and Exploration:

Loads the dataset and displays basic information (e.g., Eliot,data.describe(), data.info()`).
Checks for missing values and dataset shape.


Data Preprocessing (to be completed):

Handle missing values (e.g., drop or impute the 2 rows with missing data).
Encode categorical variables (Gender, Education Level, Job Title) using one-hot encoding or similar.
Scale numerical features (Age, Years of Experience) using StandardScaler.


Model Training (to be completed):

Split the data into training and test sets using train_test_split.
Train a LinearRegression model from scikit-learn.


Prediction and Visualization:

Generate predictions and create a bar chart comparing actual vs. predicted salaries for a subset of the data.
The visualization uses matplotlib to plot actual and predicted values side by side.



Example Visualization
The notebook includes a bar chart comparing actual and predicted salaries for 20 samples. Below is a sample of the actual vs. predicted values:
Index | Actual    | Prediction
------|-----------|-----------
0     | 180000.0  | 171912.181586
1     | 65000.0   | 103906.321901
2     | 125000.0  | 141242.014838
3     | 80000.0   | 74586.752953
4     | 140000.0  | 142592.612638

Notes

The current notebook is incomplete, as it references an OUTPUT DataFrame that is not defined in the provided code. Users must add preprocessing, training, and prediction steps to generate this DataFrame.

Example code to complete the notebook:
# Handle missing values
data = data.dropna()
# Encode categorical variables
data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['Gender', 'Education Level', 'Job Title'], drop_first=True)
# Define features and target
X = data.drop('Salary', axis=1)
y = data['Salary']
# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
# Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
# Create OUTPUT DataFrame
OUTPUT = pd.DataFrame({'ACTUAL': y_test, 'PREDICTION': y_pred})



Results

The model predicts salaries with varying accuracy, as seen in the sample output. For example, predictions for some samples are close (e.g., index 4: $140,000 vs. $142,592), while others show significant errors (e.g., index 1: $65,000 vs. $103,906).

To evaluate the model, consider adding metrics like R², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE):
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
print("R² Score:", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Mean Absolute Error:", mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("Mean Squared Error:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))



Future Improvements

Handle Outliers: Investigate and address potential outliers (e.g., the minimum salary of $350).
Feature Engineering: Explore feature interactions or polynomial features to improve model performance.
Model Evaluation: Add more evaluation metrics and visualizations (e.g., residual plots, scatter plots of actual vs. predicted values).
Alternative Models: Experiment with other algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for potentially better performance.
Cross-Validation: Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust model evaluation.
